The Lakota Sioux knew the mountainside as "The Six Grandfathers" before it was renamed in 1885 after Charles Rushmore, a New York lawyer. It attracts more than two million visitors annually.

          <p class="article-p-justify">

          <p class="article-p-justify">
            During World War II, over 110,000 Japanese residents of the United States were forcibly held in isolated military “internment” camps. Two-thirds of these prisoners were American citizens who had previously been living ordinary lives. The Manzanar site was one of 10 such camps. It is important to remember the cruelty that can be born from fear, ignorance and cultural intolerance.
