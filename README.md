# The Story Behind Land of the Free

Land of the Free was my first website, which I made for my first web development class in the spring of 2020.

We had a free choice of the topic of our site, so I decided to dedicated it to the United States because it has been my dream to move there ever since I can remember.

With this project, my main challenge was to make my ideas come to life in a way I thought was right while also obeying the constraints and guidelines that we had to follow to get a good mark.

I would probably approach this project differently now, and I could have definitely made some parts of it better.

However, fortunately, the website turned out nice all in all, and I managed to exceed the requirements.

Furthermore, I learned a lot about the importance of optimizing for different screen sizes and resolutions. And I got an appreciation for how difficult it really is to get it right.

Also, as I mentioned, this was my first website, and it was a fun experience to learn HTML and CSS.
